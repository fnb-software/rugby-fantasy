### Analysis

Japan should dominate territory in first half (_PcTerritoryFirst_).  
Samoa should dominate with mauls (many maul stats largely in favor).
It looks like the kicking game should favor Samoa as well (kicking better and retaining more possession).
Japan is more disciplined than Samoa, so the challenge for Samoa will be to score fast when they are in Japan's territory, otherwise they will lose the ball (_TurnoverOwnHalf_, _PenaltyConcededOppHalf_, _CollectionLooseBall_).
