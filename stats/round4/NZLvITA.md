### Analysis

NZL top stats are impressive in the carry area and they might well start the game very strong (_PcPossessionFirst_). It will be an interesting challenge for ITA who is leading the stats in tackle completion (_TackleSuccess_).  
ITA set piece is looking strong (_SetPieceWon_), especially the scrum (_ScrumsWonPenalty_). Both teams are excellent in the lineout.  
NZL looks dominant with kicks in play and recollecting the ball (_KickTryScored_, _KickPossessionRetained_, _CollectionSuccess_).  
ITA rucks are not very effective (_RuckSuccess_) but NZL concedes many penalties from tackles (_TacklePenaltyConceded_) so this sector will be key in order for ITA to gain momentum beside set pieces.  
We could see a better finish from ITA, with a lot of pressure on NZL (_PcTerritorySecond_), and especially in the last minutes (_TerritoryLast10Mins_).
