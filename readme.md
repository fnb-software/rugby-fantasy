## Rugby World Cup Fantasy

The goal of this project is to be able to generate the best possible fantasy team for each round that has been played.  
It's **not** a predictor.

### Rules

See the [official site](https://fantasy.rugbyworldcup.com)

### Approaches

The naive approach is a WIP.  
The [minizinc](./minizinc/readme.md) approach is working.

### Best teams

[Round 1](./teams/round1.md)  
[Round 2](./teams/round2.md)  
[Round 3](./teams/round3.md)
